## Section 2.0

All the numerators combined include the denominator in Bayes formula.

Playing around with LaTeX:

$P(x_i|y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma_y^2}}$

## Section 3.0

Everything has probability zero in a continuous distribution.

For a uniform distribution $\pi(\theta)$ is 1

$\pi({0.5}) = \int_{0}^{0.5}\pi(\theta)\, \mathrm{d}\theta = 0.5$
